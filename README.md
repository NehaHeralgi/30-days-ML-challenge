This is my 30 day challenge of working on various algorithms by implementing them as a simple project.
<br>Here is the list of all the projects below:<br/>

<br>✅Day-1,2: Introduction and overview of ML<br/>

SUPERVISED LEARNING - CLASSIFICATION & REGRESSION
<br>✅Day-3: Advertisement Sale prediction from an existing customer using<br/>

LOGISTIC REGRESSION
<br>✅Day-4: Salary Estimation using K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR<br/>
<br>✅Day-5: Character Recognition using SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE<br/>
<br>✅Day-6: Titanic Survival Prediction using NAIVE BAYES<br/>
<br>✅Day-7: Leaf Species Detection using Decision Tree<br/>
<br>✅Day-8: Handwitten digit recognition using RANDON FOREST<br/>
