# Ad_sale_Prediction
<br>**This is a simple project to Predict whether New Customers will Buy a Product or Not based on their Age and Salary.**<br/>
<br>Here I have used a dataset prepared by myself.<br/>
<br>_Steps followed are as follows:_<br/>
<br>1.Finding the problem Application:Predicting whether this New Customer will buy the product or not.<br/>
<br>2.Collecting Dataset:Based on Age,Salary of existing Customer(Purchased or Not).<br/>
<br>3.Load and Summarize Dataset.<br/>
<br>4.Segregating Dataset into X & Y(using iloc function).<br/>
<br>5.Splitting dataset into Train and Test.<br/>
<br>6.Feature Scaling: Since both the features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to higher value.
This will impact the performance.Therefore we scale our data to make all the features contribute equally to the result.<br/>
<br>7.Algorithm:Logistic Regression(Uses one or more independent variables to determine the dependent variable.<br/>
<br>8.Training model for pre-processed dataset.<br/>
<br>9.Validation:Obtaining the accuracy of the model using Confusion matrix.<br/>
<br>10.Prediction:Observing how our model is classifying our new data.<br/>
